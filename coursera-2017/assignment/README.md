This assignment involves writing three functions to work with a dataset containing 332 worksheets (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2Fspecdata.zip).

## Tasks

- âœ… Write a function named `pollutantmean` that calculates the mean of a pollutant (`sulfate` or `nitrate`) across a specified list of monitors.

- âœ… Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports the number of completely observed cases in each data file.

- âœ… Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases, then calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) exceeds the threshold.
