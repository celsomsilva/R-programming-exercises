## About this Repository

This repository is a collection of my R programming exercises, covering a wide range of topics and complexity levels.

- **Coursera 2018:** My first contact with R programming through the Johns Hopkins University Coursera course.
- **Personal Exercises:** More advanced exercises and statistical modeling projects developed independently and as part of my postgraduate studies at USP(SÃ£o Paulo University).

## Historical Note

This repository was originally created in 2018 as `R-programming-coursera` for exercises from the Coursera course. It has since been expanded to include personal and academic projects while preserving the original files and history.
